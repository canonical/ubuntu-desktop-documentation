# Manage repeated key presses

By default, when you hold down a key on your keyboard, the letter or symbol will be repeated until you release the key. If you have difficulty picking your finger back up quickly enough, you can disable this feature, or change how long it takes before key presses start repeating, or how quickly key presses repeat.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.
2. Click {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
3. Open the {guilabel}`Typing` section.
4. In the {guilabel}`Typing Assist` section, enable the {guilabel}`Repeat Keys` option.
5. Alternatively, adjust the {guilabel}`Delay` slider to control how long you have to hold a key down to begin repeating it, and adjust the {guilabel}`Speed` slider to control how quickly key presses repeat.
