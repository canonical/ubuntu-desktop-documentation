## Launch applications

GNOME has multiple ways to launch applications using the keyboard. 

### Launch applications using Activities

The quickest way is to press the Super key on your keyboard, otherwise known as the Windows key. You will then be placed in a search text field where you can start typing keywords to find the application you are looking for. Terms uch as "web browser" or "email" should help you find useful apps for browsing the web such as Firefox and Thunderbird.

GNOME

The most prominant being searching for and activating apps from the search results. To search for and launch n application, press the Super key, aka the Windows key. Orca will announce "Window", although no more information is given. You can then start typing the app name or keywords to find he app you are looking for. As you type, Orca will announce the first result that appears. Once you have entered your search terms, you can then use the arrow keys to find what you are looking for.

To search through a list of available applications, press the super key, and then press and hold Control + Alt. Use the tab key to cycle through the available system windows until you find the dash option. Release Control and Alt. You are now in the list of pinned applications. Due to being more difficult to access via keyboard, this list of pinned apps is not as useful as it is in unity, so pinning applications will not be covered. At the bottom of the list, you will find the "Show Apps" option. Press enter, and then use the arrow keys to navigate all available applications.

## Launch applications using the launcher

The Unity launcher is used to access regularly used applications, access files on removable media, and switch between running applications. The Unity launcher is accessible with the keyboard. To move to it, press Alt + F1 on your keyboard. You should hear Orca announce the first item on the launcher, which is "Search your computer and online sources". Using the arrow keys, you can move through the list of pinned applications, access any connected removable media, and access the Dash. The first icon that gets focus once you move to the launcher is another way you can get to the dash. Moving through the list of items on the Launcher, you will find some commonly useful applications and utilities. Files lets you access the contents of your home folder, Firefox is Ubuntu's default web browser, LibreOffice is the office suite shipped with Ubuntu, etc. To load an application, or open a file browser window for removable media, select the desired item with the arrow keys, and press enter.

Navigating the launcher can also tell you what applications you currently have open and running. For example, if you have Firefox open and you then navigate through the Launcher, when you navigate over the Firefox web browser item, you will be told that it is running. You should also hear the number of windows that are open for that application. Note that if an application is not running, you are given no information as to that applications' current state.

If you load an application and wish to keep it on the launcher, you need to pin it. This is done by navigating to the application on the launcher, pressing the right arrow key to open its context menu, otherwise known as a quicklist, and selecting the "Lock to Launcher" option. Other useful options are also provided by the quicklist, and the number of options available depends on the application in question.

## Switch between applications

There are 2 ways to switch between applications, via the Unity launcher as previously mentioned, and the application switcher. The application switcher is accessed by pressing and holding Alt, and pressing tab. Orca will announce that you are in the switcher window, and announce the currently selected application. If you only have one application open, then it will be selected. Otherwise, the next application in the list will be selected. TO move through the available options, keep holding the Alt key, and press tab. When you find what you are looking for, release the Alt key, and you will switch to the selected application. Note you can also go to the desktop from the application switcher. TO go to the desktop, look for "Show Desktop" in the switcher.

You can also switch between apps using the Unity launcher. To move to the launcher, press Alt + F1. Use the arrow keys to move through the available options on the launcher. Orca will notify you if the currently selected item is a running application, and if so, how many windows are open. TO switch to the selected application, press the enter key.

## Navigate application menus and system indicators

Most applications that are used in Ubuntu have a menu bar. The menu bar allows you to access many different functions of an application. There are 2 ways to get to the menus and menu items. If you know the shortcut for a particular menu in question, you can press and hold the Alt key, and then press the letter for the mnu in question. For example, if you want to access the file menu of an application, you would hold Alt, and press F. If you don't know what menus are available, and wish to browse the available menus and items, you can press Alt + F10 to get to the menu bar. You will be moved to the first menu in the menu bar. For most applications, this is likely File, or something similar. Use the down and up arrow keys to browse the currently opened menu, and use the left and right arrows to move between menus.

System indicators are used to display useful information to the user, such as current date and time, network connection status, sound, and much more. The system indicators share the same menu bar as application menus, so it is possible to navigate to them using the keyboard. As per above, you access the menu bar with Alt + F10, and navigate through the menus using the arrow keys. To navigate directly to the system indicators, press the left arrow key after pressing Alt + F10. This will move you to the system menu, which allows you to access system settings, shut down, restart, or lock your screen. Other indicators such as network, report your current network connection status, and allow you to connect to any available wireless network.
