# Navigate the interface using the keyboard

You can navigate the Ubuntu Desktop interface without a mouse, touchpad or another pointing device, using only the keyboard. This is necessary for visually impaired users who are using the screen reader, also known as Orca. However, any Desktop user can use keyboard navigation.

## Launch applications

GNOME has multiple ways to launch applications using the keyboard. 

### Launch applications using Activities

1. Press the {kbd}`Super` key on your keyboard, otherwise known as the Windows key.

    The Activities overview opens, although Orca doesn't announce it.

2. Start typing keywords to find the application that you are looking for.

    For example, terms such as *web browser* or *email* help you find applications for browsing the web such as Firefox and Thunderbird.

    As you type each letter, Orca announces the first available search result.

3. You can use {kbd}`Tab` or the arrow keys to browse the search results and find what you are looking for.


### Launch applications using the dash

The dash is the panel on the left side of the screen that contains application launchers, removable media and other icons. It's also known as the dock. You can control it using the keyboard.

1. Press {kbd}`Ctrl+Alt+Tab` to cycle through the user interface elements.
2. Select {guilabel}`Dash`.
3. Orca announces the first item in the dash, which is {guilabel}`Firefox` by default.
4. Using the arrow keys or {kbd}`Tab`, move through the list of pinned applications, access any connected removable media, and access the Dash.

    Moving through the list of items in the dash, you find commonly used applications and utilities: {guilabel}`Files` lets you access the content of your home folder, {guilabel}`Firefox` is Ubuntu's default web browser, {guilabel}`LibreOffice` is the office suite.

5. To start an application, select the item and press {kbd}`Enter`.
6. If you can't find the application in the dash, select the {guilabel}`Show Apps` item. Browse the list of all installed applications using {kbd}`Tab` and the arrow keys.

If you know the position of the application in the dash, you can activate it by pressing {kbd}`Super+Number`.

## Switch between applications

### Switch between applications using the application switcher

There are 2 ways to switch between applications, via the Unity launcher as previously mentioned, and the application switcher. The application switcher is accessed by pressing and holding Alt, and pressing tab. Orca will announce that you are in the switcher window, and announce the currently selected application. If you only have one application open, then it will be selected. Otherwise, the next application in the list will be selected. TO move through the available options, keep holding the Alt key, and press tab. When you find what you are looking for, release the Alt key, and you will switch to the selected application. Note you can also go to the desktop from the application switcher. TO go to the desktop, look for "Show Desktop" in the switcher.

The application switcher is accessed by pressing and holding Alt, and pressing tab. Orca will announce that you are in the switcher window, and announce the currently selected application. If you only have one application open, then it will be selected. Otherwise, the next application in the list will be selected. TO move through the available options, keep holding the Alt key, and press tab. When you find what you are looking for, release the Alt key, and you will switch to the selected application.

### Switch between applications using the dash

1. Activate the dash interface using {kbd}`Ctrl+Alt+Tab`.
2. Select an application using the arrow keys or {kbd}`Tab`.
3. Open the menu using the {kbd}`Menu` key or {kbd}`Shift+F10`.
4. If Orca announces *All Windows*, the application is running.

    You can expand the list of open windows using {kbd}`Enter`, {kbd}`Space` or {kbd}`→`.

    Browse the open windows using the arrow keys.

    To close the list of windows, press {kbd}`Esc` or {kbd}`←`.

5. You can remove the application from the dash by selecting {guilabel}`Unpin`.

    You can quit the application by selecting {guilabel}`Quit`.

    If an application is running but it isn't pinned to the dash, you can add it by selecting {guilabel}`Pin to Dash`.

### Switch between applications using Activities

## Navigate application menus and system indicators

Most applications that are used in Ubuntu have a menu bar. The menu bar allows you to access many different functions of an application. There are 2 ways to get to the menus and menu items. If you know the shortcut for a particular menu in question, you can press and hold the Alt key, and then press the letter for the mnu in question. For example, if you want to access the file menu of an application, you would hold Alt, and press F. If you don't know what menus are available, and wish to browse the available menus and items, you can press Alt + F10 to get to the menu bar. You will be moved to the first menu in the menu bar. For most applications, this is likely File, or something similar. Use the down and up arrow keys to browse the currently opened menu, and use the left and right arrows to move between menus.

System indicators are used to display useful information to the user, such as current date and time, network connection status, sound, and much more. The system indicators share the same menu bar as application menus, so it is possible to navigate to them using the keyboard. As per above, you access the menu bar with Alt + F10, and navigate through the menus using the arrow keys. To navigate directly to the system indicators, press the left arrow key after pressing Alt + F10. This will move you to the system menu, which allows you to access system settings, shut down, restart, or lock your screen. Other indicators such as network, report your current network connection status, and allow you to connect to any available wireless network.

## Navigate the panel

Like Unity, GNOME shell also has a top panel that lets you access some application menus, system settings and network configuration. To access the top panel, press and hold Control + Alt, and press the tab key until you hear Orca announce "Top Bar". Release Control and Alt, and use the arrow keys to navigate the items on the top panel. Press enter to open a menu, and use arrow to move through the available options. To return to an application, switch apps as per the documentation above.
