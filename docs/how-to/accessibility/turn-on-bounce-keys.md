# Turn on bounce keys

Turn on *bounce keys* to ignore key presses that are rapidly repeated. For example, if you have hand tremors which cause you to press a key multiple times when you only want to press it once, you should turn on bounce keys.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.
2. Click {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
3. Open the {guilabel}`Typing` section.
4. In the {guilabel}`Typing Assist` section, enable the {guilabel}`Bounce Keys` option.

:::{tip}
You can turn bounce keys on and off by clicking the {ref}`accessibility icon <find-the-accessibility-menu>` on the top bar and selecting {guilabel}`Bounce Keys`. The accessibility icon is visible when one or more settings have been enabled from the {guilabel}`Accessibility` panel.
:::

Use the {guilabel}`Acceptance` delay slider to change how long bounce keys waits before it registers another key press after you pressed the key for the first time. Select {guilabel}`Beep when a key is rejected` if you want the computer to make a sound each time it ignores a key press because it happened too soon after the previous key press.
