# Read screen in Braille

The Orca screen reader can display the user interface on a refreshable Braille display. Depending on how you installed your system, you might not have Orca installed. If not, install Orca first.

Refer to the [Orca Help](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/index.html.en) for more information.
