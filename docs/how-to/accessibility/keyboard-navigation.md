# Keyboard navigation

This page details keyboard navigation for people who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device, or who want to use a keyboard as much as possible. For keyboard shortcuts that are useful to all users, see Useful keyboard shortcuts instead.

:::{tip}
If you cannot use a pointing device like a mouse, you can control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on your keyboard. See {ref}`click-and-move-the-mouse-pointer-using-the-keypad` for details.

## Navigate user interfaces

* - Keys
  - Action

* - {kbd}`Tab` and {kbd}`Ctrl+Tab`
  - Move keyboard focus between different controls. {kbd}`Ctrl+Tab` moves between groups of controls, such as from a sidebar to the main content. {kbd}`Ctrl+Tab` can also break out of a control that uses {kbd}`Tab` itself, such as a text area.

    Hold down {kbd}`Shift` to move focus in reverse order.

* - Arrow keys
  - Move selection between items in a single control, or among a set of related controls. Use the arrow keys to focus buttons in a toolbar, select items in a list or grid view, or select a radio button from a group.

* - {kbd}`Ctrl`+Arrow keys
  - In a list or grid view, move the keyboard focus to another item without changing which item is selected.

* - {kbd}`Shift`+Arrow keys
  - In a list or grid view, select all items from the currently selected item to the newly focused item.

    In a tree view, items that have children can be expanded or collapsed, to show or hide their children: expand by pressing {kbd}`Shift+→`, and collapse by pressing {kbd}`Shift+←`.

* - {kbd}`Space`
  - Activate a focused item such as a button, check box, or list item.

* - {kbd}`Ctrl+Space`
  - In a list or grid view, select or deselect the focused item without deselecting other items.

* - {kbd}`Alt`
  - Hold down the {kbd}`Alt` key to reveal *accelerators*: underlined letters on menu items, buttons, and other controls. Press {kbd}`Alt` plus the underlined letter to activate a control, just as if you had clicked on it.

* - {kbd}`Esc`
  - Exit a menu, popup, switcher, or dialog window.

* - {kbd}`F10`
  - Open the first menu on the menubar of a window. Use the arrow keys to navigate the menus.

* - {kbd}`Shift+F10` or {kbd}`Menu`
  - Pop up the context menu for the current selection, as if you had right-clicked.

* - {kbd}`Ctrl+F10`
  - In the file manager, pop up the context menu for the current folder, as if you had right-clicked on the background and not on any item.

* - {kbd}`Ctrl+PageUp` and {kbd}`Ctrl+PageDown`
