# Adjust the contrast

You can adjust the contrast of windows and buttons so that theyâ€™re easier to see. This is not the same as changing the brightness of the whole screen; only parts of the user interface will change.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.
2. Click {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
3. Open the {guilabel}`Seeing` section.
4. Enable the {guilabel}`High Contrast` option.

:::{tip}
You can turn high contrast on and off by clicking the {ref}`accessibility icon <find-the-accessibility-menu>` on the top bar and selecting {guilabel}`High Contrast`.
