# Click and move the mouse pointer using the keypad

If you have difficulties using a mouse or other pointing device, you can control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on your keyboard. This feature is called **mouse keys**.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.

    You can access the Activities overview by pressing on it, by moving your mouse pointer against the top-left corner of the screen, by using {kbd}`Ctrl+Alt+Tab` followed by {kbd}`Enter`, or by using the {kbd}`Super` key.

3. Click {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
4. Open the {guilabel}`Pointing & Clicking` section.
5. Enable the {guilabel}`Mouse Keys` option.
6. Make sure that {kbd}`Num Lock` is turned off.

You will now be able to move the mouse pointer using the keypad.

The keypad is a set of numerical buttons on your keyboard, usually arranged into a square grid. If you have a keyboard without a keypad (such as a laptop keyboard), you may need to hold down the function ({kbd}`Fn`) key and use certain other keys on your keyboard as a keypad. If you use this feature often on a laptop, you can purchase external USB or Bluetooth numeric keypads.

Each number on the keypad corresponds to a direction. For example, pressing {kbd}`8` will move the pointer upwards and pressing {kbd}`2` will move it downwards. Press the {kbd}`5` key to click once with the mouse, or quickly press it twice to double-click.

<!--
The list table doesn't really represent well what it renders as. A standard Markdown table would be more visually readable:

| 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |

However, this style of table requires a header, which we don't want here. The list table is a workaround.

Most keyboards have a special key which allows you to right-click, sometimes called the {kbd}`Menu` key. Note, however, that this key responds to where your keyboard focus is, not where your mouse pointer is. See {ref}`simulate-a-right-mouse-click` for information on how to right-click by holding down {kbd}`5` or the left mouse button.

If you want to use the keypad to type numbers while mouse keys is enabled, turn {kbd}`Num Lock` on. The mouse cannot be controlled with the keypad when {kbd}`Num Lock` is turned on, though.

:::{note}
The normal number keys, in a line at the top of the keyboard, will not control the mouse pointer. Only the keypad number keys can be used.
