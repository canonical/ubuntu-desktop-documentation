# Turn on slow keys

Turn on *slow keys* if you would like there to be a delay between pressing a key and that letter being displayed on the screen. This means that you have to hold down each key you want to type for a little while before it appears. Use slow keys if you accidentally press several keys at a time when you type, or if you find it difficult to press the right key on the keyboard first time.

1. Open the Activities overview and start typing **accessibility**.
2. Click {guilabel}`Accessibility` to open the panel.
3. Open the {guilabel}`Typing` section.
4. In the {guilabel}`Typing Assist` section, enable the {guilabel}`Slow Keys` option.

:::{tip}
Select the {guilabel}`Enable by Keyboard` option to turn slow keys on and off from the keyboard. When this option is selected, you can press and hold {kbd}`Shift` for eight seconds to enable or disable slow keys.

You can also turn slow keys on and off by clicking the {ref}`accessibility icon <find-the-accessibility-menu>` on the top bar and selecting {guilabel}`Slow Keys`. The accessibility icon is visible when one or more settings have been enabled from the {guilabel}`Accessibility` panel.
:::

Use the {guilabel}`Acceptance` delay slider to control how long you have to hold a key down for it to register. See {ref}`turn-on-bounce-keys` for more information.

You can have your computer make a sound when you press a key, when a key press is accepted, or when a key press is rejected because you didnâ€™t hold the key down long enough.
