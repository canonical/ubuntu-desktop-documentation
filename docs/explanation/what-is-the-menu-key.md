# What is the Menu key?

The {kbd}`Menu` key, also known as the *Application* key, is a key found on some Windows-oriented keyboards. This key is usually on the bottom-right of the keyboard, next to the {kbd}`Ctrl` key, but it can be placed in a different location by keyboard manufacturers. It is usually depicted as a cursor hovering above a menu: {kbd}`â‰£ðŸ¡´`.

The primary function of this key is to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than by clicking the right mouse button: this is useful if mouse or a similar device is not available, or when the right mouse button is not present.

The {kbd}`Menu` key is sometimes omitted in the interest of space, particularly on portable and laptop keyboards. In this case, some keyboards include a {kbd}`Menu` function key that can be activated in combination with the Function ({kbd}`Fn`) key.

The *context menu* is a menu that pops up when you right-click. The menu that you see, if any, is dependent on the context and function of the area that you right-clicked. When you use the {kbd}`Menu` key, the context menu is shown for the area of the screen that your cursor is over at the point when the key is pressed.
